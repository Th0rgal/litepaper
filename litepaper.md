## What's cash.place?
cash.place is a secured middleman platform. It allows buyers and 
sellers using bitcoin to trade safe from being scammed. 

## What are the advantages of cash.place over a traditional middleman?
- cash.place is faster
- cash.place is cheaper
- cash.place is safer

## But what happens if there is a problem with my transaction?
cash.place is semi-automatic: if there isno problem, the transfer 
takes place automatically. If the bitcoins are not delivered, the 
transaction is cancelled. If the counterparty is not delivered 
(or if there is a problem with it), the Bitcoin spender can open 
a dispute to involve a human who will decide.

## What about my privacy?
cash.place does not require you to create an account, just set a 
temporary password for the transaction. If the transaction is 
successful, the ticket will be deleted after 24 hours and the 
only trace left will be the transaction in the blockchain. If you 
need to involve a human to settle a dispute, you will decide 
what information you wish to disclose.
